What:		/sys/devices/.../deferred_probe
Date:		August 2016
Contact:	Ben Hutchings <ben.hutchings@codethink.co.uk>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../deferred_probe attribute is
		present for all devices.  If a driver detects during
		probing a device that a related device is not yet
		ready, it may defer probing of the first device.  The
		kernel will retry probing the first device after any
		other device is successfully probed.  This attribute
		reads as 1 if probing of this device is currently
		deferred, or 0 otherwise.
